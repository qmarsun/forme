How Dutch Auction Set Rate for VARs Security
The Dutch auction process is a method used to set the rate for auction rate securities (ARS) by allowing investors to bid for the amount of the offering they are willing to buy and the price they are willing to pay. The process involves the following steps:
Bidding: Investors submit bids specifying the number of shares and the lowest interest rate they would accept.
Auction: A Dutch auction is held at the beginning of each holding period, which determines the coupon/dividend for the next holding period.
Clearing Rate: The lowest bid rate at which all the shares can be sold at par establishes the interest rate, known as the "clearing rate."
Market Dynamics: The total number of shares available to auction at any given period is determined by the number of existing bond holders who wish to sell or hold bonds only at a minimum yield.
Market Collapse: In 2008, the ARS market collapsed when auctions could not attract enough bidders to establish a clearing rate, leaving many investors with illiquid long-term investments.

The Dutch auction process is a competitive bidding process designed to determine a rate for the next term, such that all sellers sell at par and all buyers buy at par. This process ensures that all bidders on an ARS receive the same yield on the debt issue, providing a sense of security and liquidity for investors.
