What Happens When You "Disable" or "Delete" a Certificate in Venafi TLS Protect?
Action	Effect
Disable	Prevents Venafi from managing or renewing the cert, but it still exists. Does not revoke or remove it from systems unless specifically configured.
Delete	Removes the certificate object from Venafi inventory. If automated workflows exist (e.g., cert deployment), it may stop further action.
Revoke	Actually tells the CA to revoke the cert (if Venafi is integrated with the CA and revocation is configured).

I have questions SSL/TLS certification revoke process
ChatGPT said:
Great — feel free to ask your questions about the SSL/TLS certificate revocation process. To help you get the most accurate answers, here’s a quick overview of the process:

🔐 Overview of SSL/TLS Certificate Revocation
When a certificate is no longer trusted before its expiration (e.g., due to a private key being compromised), it should be revoked. This tells clients not to trust it anymore.

🔄 Common Revocation Mechanisms:
CRL (Certificate Revocation List):

A list of revoked certificates published by the Certificate Authority (CA).

Clients download the list and check if a cert is on it.

Not real-time and can be slow to update.

OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol):

Real-time query to the CA to check a certificate’s revocation status.

Faster than CRL but can still slow down connections.

OCSP Stapling can improve performance.

OCSP Stapling:

The server periodically gets an OCSP response from the CA and “staples” it to the TLS handshake.

More privacy, faster, and more reliable.

🧠 Typical Questions People Ask:
How do I revoke a certificate with my CA?

What happens after revocation — how do clients know?

How long does it take for revocation to take effect?

What’s the difference between revocation and expiration?

Is OCSP checking enforced in modern browsers?

Go ahead and ask your questions — whether technical or procedural.

You said:
I have two certifiate with same common name say mysite.com
ChatGPT said:
Got it. You have two SSL/TLS certificates with the same Common Name (CN), like mysite.com. That's perfectly valid — multiple certificates can cover the same domain, especially in these cases:

✅ Common Scenarios for Multiple Certificates with Same CN:
Transitioning or renewing certificates

A new cert is issued while the old one is still active.

Multiple hosting environments

For example, one cert is used on a production server, and another on a staging server.

Different Certificate Authorities (CAs)

You may have obtained certificates from different CAs for redundancy or testing.

Different certificate types

One cert could be DV (Domain Validated), and another could be EV (Extended Validation).

🔄 Now, Regarding Revocation:
If you’re asking about revoking one of those certificates (not both), here’s how it works:

🧾 1. Does revoking one certificate affect the other?
No. Each certificate is unique and tied to:

Its own serial number

Its own private key

Its issuance by the CA

Revoking one does not affect the validity of the other — even if they have the same Common Name.

🛠️ 2. How do I revoke just one certificate?
You’ll need:

The certificate’s serial number

Your CA’s revocation interface (or API)

Your CA account or certificate management access

Possibly the private key to confirm ownership (for some revocation paths)

Your Certificate Authority (CA) should allow you to revoke a certificate by specifying its serial number.

🚦 3. After revocation, how will clients know?
The revoked certificate’s serial number is:

Added to the CRL

Returned as “revoked” in OCSP responses

Clients or browsers checking the cert via CRL or OCSP will then reject it. The other certificate (with a different serial number) remains trusted.

You said:
2nd certicate has two SAN and first certificate has one SAN
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the added detail. So now the situation is:

📌 You Have:
Certificate 1 (Old or Existing):

CN: mysite.com

SANs: mysite.com

Certificate 2 (New or Parallel):

CN: mysite.com

SANs: mysite.com, www.mysite.com

✅ Is That Valid?
Yes — it’s completely valid to have multiple certificates:

With the same Common Name (CN)

But different SANs (Subject Alternative Names)

As long as they’re issued by a trusted CA and configured properly

They are treated as separate certificates by systems, browsers, and servers.

❓Your Likely Question:
If I revoke one certificate (say, the one with only mysite.com), what happens to the other one?

🔄 Answer: Revoking One Certificate Doesn’t Affect the Other
Each certificate has:

A unique serial number

Its own OCSP/CRL record

So revoking Certificate 1 (with 1 SAN) will:

Not impact Certificate 2 (with 2 SANs)

Browsers/clients will still trust Certificate 2, assuming it's valid and properly installed

🧪 Example Use Case:
You may have replaced Cert 1 with Cert 2 because you added www.mysite.com support

You now want to revoke Cert 1 to ensure it’s no longer used (maybe its private key was compromised or just for good hygiene)

That’s the right thing to do.

🛑 How to Be Careful:
Before revoking Cert 1:

Ensure Cert 2 is installed and active on all servers or services using mysite.com

Use tools like:

openssl s_client -connect mysite.com:443 -showcerts
...to verify which cert is actually served

If Cert 1 is still served somewhere, revoking it will break connections for clients doing revocation checks.

🚀 Want to Revoke Cert 1?
You’ll need:

The certificate file or serial number

Access to your CA’s portal or API

Possibly the private key or proof of ownership (depends on the CA)

I can guide you through the exact revocation process if you tell me:

Which Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, Sectigo) you used

Or I can show how to compare both certs by inspecting them and seeing their serial numbers/SANs/validity dates if you have them available.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

You said:
2nd has mysite.com  mysite.detail.com
ChatGPT said:
Thanks — now it’s clear. You have:

📜 Two SSL/TLS Certificates for mysite.com:
✅ Certificate 1 (old or existing):
Common Name (CN): mysite.com

Subject Alternative Names (SANs): mysite.com

✅ Certificate 2 (new or parallel):
Common Name (CN): mysite.com

Subject Alternative Names (SANs): mysite.com, mysite.detail.com

❓Your Likely Concern
You might be asking:

What happens if I revoke Certificate 1 (with only mysite.com)?

Will clients visiting mysite.com still work?

Will the second certificate cover everything I need?

✅ Answer: You’re OK to Revoke the First Certificate, If…
🔍 As long as:
Certificate 2 is already installed and actively being served for mysite.com

mysite.detail.com is also using Certificate 2 (if it's hosted and active)

All services (web servers, load balancers, etc.) are configured to use only Certificate 2

Then you can safely revoke Certificate 1, and nothing will break.

🚦 Important Considerations Before Revocation:
Checkpoint	What to Verify
🧾 Current Certificate	Use openssl or browser tools to verify which cert is actually served at mysite.com
🔐 Private Key Match	Ensure you're not revoking the cert that matches the current private key on the server
🌐 Server Configuration	Double-check all environments (prod, staging, etc.) use Certificate 2
🔄 Load Balancer/CDN	If using one (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS ELB), make sure it also uses Certificate 2
🛠️ How to Check Which Certificate Is Active
Run this from a terminal:

openssl s_client -connect mysite.com:443 -servername mysite.com | openssl x509 -noout -text
Look for:

Subject: → shows CN

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: → shows SANs (mysite.com, mysite.detail.com)

Serial Number: → confirms which cert is being used

Do the same for mysite.detail.com if needed.

✅ TL;DR Summary:
You can have multiple certificates with overlapping CN/SANs

Revoking one will not affect the other

Make sure Certificate 2 is fully deployed

Revoking Certificate 1 is safe once it's no longer served

Would you like help:

Comparing both certificates using their files?

Finding how to revoke a cert with your specific CA?

Verifying what’s currently live on your domains?

Let me know what step you're on.

You said:
if I revoke first cert1 with CA authority will this revoke  2nd certificate
ChatGPT said:
No, revoking Certificate 1 will not revoke Certificate 2, even though they share the same Common Name (mysite.com) and overlap in SANs.

🔐 Why?
Because SSL/TLS certificates are uniquely identified by their serial number and issuer (CA). Even if:

Both certs have the same CN (mysite.com)

Both are issued by the same CA

Both are for the same domain

They are treated as completely separate certificates by the CA and by clients (browsers, servers, etc.).

✅ So when you revoke Cert 1:
The CA adds only Cert 1’s serial number to their CRL/OCSP list.

Cert 2 remains valid and trusted until its expiration or until you explicitly revoke it.

🔍 You Can Confirm This by:
Comparing the serial numbers of Cert 1 and Cert 2

openssl x509 -in cert1.pem -noout -serial
openssl x509 -in cert2.pem -noout -serial
Checking their OCSP status separately using openssl:

openssl ocsp -issuer <issuer.pem> -cert cert1.pem -url <OCSP URL>
openssl ocsp -issuer <issuer.pem> -cert cert2.pem -url <OCSP URL>
🛑 Final Note
You only revoke a certificate by:

Logging into your CA dashboard

Selecting the specific cert (usually by order ID or serial number)

Submitting a revocation request

Unless you explicitly revoke Cert 2 as well, it stays valid.

If you'd like, I can walk you through:

Finding and comparing the serial numbers

Sending a revocation request (specific to your CA)

Verifying which cert is in use on your server
